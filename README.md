# Valerie's Slack Hacks

These were previously in seperate repos, but I realized I don't want to burn all my free Heroku dynos on silly Slack integrations.

These are two slack slash command integrations, running at slack-hacks.herokuapp.com. Feel free to use them on your Slack teams.

## Celebrate
This adds the :tada: emoji between all the letters of every command you send to it.
